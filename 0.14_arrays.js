Create an array called numbers(see below) and console.log the sum of indices 0, 2, 4,6 

var numbers = [8,6,7,5,3,0,9]
	Add numbers in the 0, 2, 4, 6 index.
	Should print: 27


CHALLENGE: SILVER

Compose an array of classmate names for the people on your row. 
Iterate over the names, then give a personalize message to each of them. 



CHALLENGE: GOLD

A
Write a function that accepts a parameter and then adds all the numbers together from the num array below.  (HINT! You will need to use a sum variable to keep track of your total.  You will need a loop and also the correct notation to access each index (think bronze challenge)

var num = [8,6,7,5,3,0,9];

If you finish the first one, 

Using only for loops create a tree that looks like this:

0 : 2 : 4
0 : 2 : 5
0 : 3 : 4
0 : 3 : 5
1 : 2 : 4
1 : 2 : 5
1 : 3 : 4
1 : 3 : 5
